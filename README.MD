<h3 align="center">About</h3>

Smooth Swapping is a client side mod that animates item movement inside of inventories.

- It is avaible for Fabric and Forge (since Minecraft version 1.19.4)

- Eventhough it is written using Architectury it does **not** need the Aechtectury API, neither for Forge or Fabric

- If you use the Fabric version you need the [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and you will need [Modmenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) to able to access the settings menu
